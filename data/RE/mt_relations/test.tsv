Genetic deletion of let-7, antagomir-mediated blockage of let-7 and @MiRNA$ * action, transgenic expression of dp target protector, or replacement of endogenous dp with a dp transgene non-responsive to let-7 each had toxic effects similar to those of pathogenic @DISEASE$.	0
We therefore carried out microRNA (@MiRNA$ ) profiling from peripheral blood to detect and identify characteristic patterns in @DISEASE$.	0
@MiRNA$ expression profiling of both mouse and human medulloblastomas has led to the identification of signatures correlating with the molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma, @DISEASE$ diagnosis and response to treatment, as well as novel targets of potential clinical relevance.	0
Comparison of mouse cerebellar development and @MiRNA$ demonstrates a shared @DISEASE$ -mRNA co-expression program for brain-specific neurologic processes such as synaptic transmission and exocytosis, in which miRNA target expression increases with the accumulation of multiple miRNAs in developing cerebellum and decreases with the loss of these miRNAs in brain tumors.	0
Consistent with an impairment of miRNA-mediated regulation of BACE1 expression, these findings prompted us to investigate the regulatory role of the BACE1 3'-@MiRNA$ lement and the possible involvement of specific miRNAs in cultured neuronal (N2a) and fibroblastic (NIH 3T3) ce@DISEASE$.	0
Recent studies have also demonstrated that microRNAs (@MiRNA$ ) may be responsible for the modulation of @DISEASE$ -implicated genes in tumors.	0
PDCD4 nuclear loss inversely correlates with @MiRNA$ levels in colon @DISEASE$.	1
These data demonstrate that @MiRNA$ 1 accelerates @DISEASE$ and promotes a more disseminated disease.	1
We hypothesized that @MiRNA$ expression profiles in @DISEASE$ (hippocampus) would show common as well as unique profiles when compared with those of blood.	0
Ectopic @MiRNA$ expression in CGNPs synergized with exogenous @DISEASE$ to increase proliferation and also enabled them to proliferate in the absence of Shh.	1
A Functional Variant in @MiRNA$ (rs11614913 SNP) Is Associated with Susceptibility of @DISEASE$ in a Chinese Population.	1
These results are the first to demonstrate that levels of human @MiRNA$ can be regulated by @DISEASE$.	1
@MiRNA$ and miR-16-1 function by targeting multiple oncogenes, including @DISEASE$, MCL1, CCND1, and WNT3A.	1
The @MiRNA$ and its target THBS1 are differentially expressed in @DISEASE$ dependent on MYC amplification.	1
